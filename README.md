IoMT-Based Smart Health Monitoring and Early Disease Alert System

The IoMT-Based Smart Health Monitoring and Early Disease Alert System is a mini project developed to enable continuous, real-time health monitoring using biomedical sensors, cloud connectivity, and machine learning. The system monitors vital health parameters and predicts early signs of potential health risks, enabling timely alerts and preventive care.

This project demonstrates how the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) combined with Machine Learning (ML) can enhance remote healthcare monitoring, reduce hospital dependency, and improve patient safety.

Objectives:

1. Design an IoMT-based system for continuous monitoring of vital health parameters
2. Collect and transmit real-time physiological data via a cloud-connected microcontroller
3. Develop ML models to detect early health risks such as fever, hypoxia, and abnormal heart rate
4. Generate automated alerts during abnormal health conditions
5. Provide a web-based dashboard for live data visualization and analytics
